Family and friends asked whether there’s a name for this kind of tumour.

Well, yes. When I was receiving the MRI scan results, my consultant surgeon actually mentioned the term “pleomorphic adenoma” but didn’t dwell on it. Neither did I pay too much attention or ask for details. “Adenoma” refers to benign tumours originating from epithelial cells of glands (e.g. the thyroid), whereas “pleomorphic” is an adjective describing the nonhomogeneous nature of the tumour cells’ shape and size. In my case, the tumour probably started from a salivary gland. Back then, I wasn’t too concerned about the tumour’s origin since it wouldn’t affect the treatment or prognosis. Instead, I was more interested in its size, location and malignancy.

The medical term for the tumour is quite a mouthful, but it did get named, unexpectedly! In the days after meeting my consultant surgeon, the imagery of “knife-on-neck” often played on my mind. I had to verbalise this uneasiness, and my very good friend (the one who rescued me emotionally in the car) duly obliged to be the listener. I lamented again on how this tumour was impalpable and invisible from the outside. He paused for a bit, as if something had come to mind, and uttered calmly, “this is a ninja tumour”. It’s impossible to keep a long face when one’s suddenly hit by such a cute nickname. The mood in the room was suddenly lifted. Friends have all fallen for this name, or simply called it “the ninja”.

>Another question from family and friends — how about a biopsy?

No, we didn’t bother with one before the operation because it’s not worth performing an invasive procedure when its outcome wouldn’t impact on the treatment plan. The histological analyses could wait till after the operation and conducted on the entire tumour. However, a CT scan was required to check the bone anatomy around the tumour, even though it’s pretty rare that a benign tumour would invade bones.

The scan was scheduled for the morning of the International Women’s Day, which also happened to fall on a Sunday. Without the usual hustle and bustle of people, cars and ambulances, the hospital site was quite peaceful. Only the most urgent cases are being dealt with on Sundays, so I believed my consultant really meant it when he talked about fast-tracking.

The CT scan clinic is part of the outpatients department. As I approached the department’s entrance, I suddenly realised it’s locked! Same for the side doors! Umm… there must be a way in, just not sure where from exactly. After walking back and forth, I still couldn’t find it. I approached two paramedics who were taking care of their ambulances — maybe they would have some insider knowledge? They dropped what they’re doing and kindly searched with me, but unfortunately to no avail. The clock was ticking. “Right, let me call the outpatients department,” I decided. No answer. Oh dear…... 

Then I noticed the hospital main switchboard’s number on the appointment letter. “Let’s give this a go, there’s nothing to lose.” Someone picked up the phone at the other end, hurray! Far from easing my nerves, the operator’s response was monotonic and uninterested, “just go to the main entrance.” The hospital is a complex of multiple buildings with many entrances; which entrance is the “main” one? I suddenly remembered previously coming across quite a large revolving door with the hospital’s name above it. 

“Ah, you mean the revolving door?”<br>
“Yes.”

“Then what?” I mumbled to myself. I was baffled, but the operator just kept repeating the same instruction. I didn’t have time to argue with him, so just did as told.

It made sense once I got to the main entrance. From there one could reach different departments via a labyrinth of corridors and underpasses, as long as you followed the signs carefully. Since then, I reminded myself if I ever had a Sunday appointment again, I should allow extra time for finding my way.

Why do I remember this episode so vividly? That’s because over my numerous visits at the hospital, members of staff were all helpful and warm; the seemingly outsourced switchboard service stood out as the exception.

Finally I made it to the CT scan clinic, phew. It’s quiet. The tables have turned —  the nurse and technician had been waiting for me. The nurse, who by chance has the same name as my brother’s, was a softly-spoken guy with very steady hands. In came the CT contrast-feeding cannula on the first try, then out it came also effortlessly after the scan. The prick barely hurt and I didn’t get any bruises afterwards. Who said only ladies are good at tactile tasks?

I had to attend the CT scan with an empty stomach, so by the time I left the clinic after midday, I was starving. It was a beautiful day in early spring, so I made an impromptu visit to my favourite Japanese restaurant and celebrated the little progress in my treatment with a tasty lunch. I also took the opportunity to break the news about the ninja to the restaurant’s manager, who’s a friend of mine.

Carpe diem! Shortly after that meal, the UK was plunged into an unprecedented lockdown due to COVID-19, when eateries were only allowed to serve takeaways. The next time I set foot in the same restaurant again would be four months later, in mid-summer, when the “ninja” was ousted.

<p class="cn">不少親友問腫瘤有沒有特別名稱？

<p class="cn">第一次見主診醫生時，他其實有略略提過腫瘤可能屬 pleomorphic adenoma，只是我沒聼凖，也沒追問。Adenoma 是泛指源自腺體（例如甲狀腺）表皮細胞的良性腫瘤，而 pleomorphic 是形容腫瘤細胞形狀、大小參差。在我而言，那腺體很可能是口水腺。當時我最有興趣知道的是腫瘤位置、大小、是良是惡。它起源自什麽器官的哪類細胞，我不急着要知道，反正不影響治療方案。

<p class="cn">名稱繞口，名字還是有的，而且是無意中取的！見過主診醫生後的十天八天，每想到「刀架頸上」，總是有些忐忑不安，不吐不快。一天，我神色凝重的跟上次來救亡的好友說，這腫瘤看不到、摸不到啊，真無奈。我也不是第一次講這些了，難得他仍耐心聼。他頓了一下，若有所思的說：「This is a ninja tumour. （這是個隱者腫瘤 。）」如此出其不意的暱稱一下子吹散沉鬱的氣氛，我忍俊不禁。醫學名稱太繞口，朋友間都喜歡這可愛暱稱，就簡稱為 “the ninja”「隱者」。

<p class="cn">親友又問，有沒有抽取組織去化驗？

<p class="cn">離手術日期不遠，主診醫生說犯不着急於抽取組織去化驗，畢竟取樣本要用刺針，屬「入侵性」，可免則免，待腫瘤切除後再驗也未遲。不過，要做一次 CT 掃描，看清楚腫瘤四周骨頭的狀況，儘管這種良性瘤入侵骨頭的機會很微。

<p class="cn">掃描安排在婦女節早上，是星期日。平日（病）人多、（救護）車多的醫院，星期日安靜下來了。只有病情最緊急的病人安排在星期日做檢查，可見主診醫生說「盡快排期」所言非虛。

<p class="cn">掃描組屬門診部。走到門診部大門，忽然發現它上了鎖！側門也關了…… 一定有入口的，只是不知道在哪。來來回回走了幾圈，還是找不到耶。遇上在打理救護車的救護員，我以爲他們熟悉醫院的地圖吧？他們熱心陪我找了一會兒，可是依然徒勞。眼看快到預約時間，打電話往門診部問問吧。啊，響了好久都沒人接聽！怎辦呢？

<p class="cn">預約通知書上有醫院總機的電話號碼。無計可施，就試試吧。終於有人接聽，大喜！豈料，另一端傳來的是晦氣的回答：「你去醫院正門便是了。」正門？這醫院由很多棟建築組成，出入口甚多，哪個才是正門？忽然記起有一道頗大的旋轉門，上方寫著醫院的名字。「是旋轉門那個嗎？」「是。」找到正門又如何？對方只是重覆叫我去正門，眼看快遲到了，沒時間爭辯，唯有照辦。

<p class="cn">啊，原來正門附近有很多四通八達的迂迴通道，連接到其他部門及鄰近建築，若稍不留神看漏了指示，隨時走入迷宮。自此，我就記住如果星期日去醫院就預留時間，萬一迷路、要繞路也不用着急。

<p class="cn">爲何特別記得這折騰？因爲醫院上上下下都是客客氣氣的，只有醫院的「客戶服務部」像是外判了的？

<p class="cn">終於找到 CT 掃描部。是護士和技術員在等我，與平日門診的忙碌大相徑庭。替我插導管注射顯影劑的護士凑巧與我弟弟一樣名字，也同樣溫文爾雅。手不抖不顫，插針一擊即中。掃描後輕鬆拔出導管，針孔附近幾乎毫無瘀痕，是怕痛之人的福音。誰說一定是女生手勢才好？

<p class="cn">空着肚子去掃描，離開醫院時已過中午。趁初春天氣不錯，就即興往相熟的日本餐廳吃個豐盛的午餐，慶祝於治療路上又踏前一步，順便把腫瘤的事告知餐廳經理。

<p class="cn">人生得意須盡歡，因爲不久後英國就因 COVID-19 疫情而破天荒「封城」，期間食肆都只能做外賣。吃過那一餐後，重返餐廳要等到四個多月後，「隱者」被抓出來後的夏天。

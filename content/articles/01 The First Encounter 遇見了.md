It was a Saturday, also Lunar New Year’s Day. Festivities without spending my annual leave allowance, nice. Just before bed, it was time to floss and brush my teeth. That evening, I opened my mouth super wide for an extra check on my four wisdom teeth, to validate whether my simplified dental care regime was adequate when earlier that month I travelled light for a holiday, without bringing the electric toothbrush.

**“Ah ——”**

The wisdom teeth were all fine, my dentist would be pleased.

But hold on! The back of my throat was asymmetrical, how come!? The dangling “bell”♯ should be at the centre but it shifted to the right! Oh, there was a big swelling protruding from the roof of my mouth (the soft palate), and it seemed to be pushing the “bell” off position.

My first reaction was to give the lump a little prod. It’s firm, with not much give, but there’s no pain whatsoever. Well, if it’s painful, at least I could have blamed it on some sort of gum infection related to the wisdom tooth. But then if it’s really inflammation, the pain would have made my life pretty miserable and I couldn’t have been oblivious to its presence through the holiday and festive feasting.

So, what could it be? Everyone started guessing. An unusual dental condition? A fluid-filled cyst? 

>Nobody dared mentioning the tabooed “C”&nbsp;word&nbsp;though.

Guesses wouldn’t get me anywhere, so I promptly sought medical help. My trusted traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) doctor (who also trained in western medicine) said he didn’t have a clue what the swelling could be and TCM can’t help, so urged me to see my general practitioner (GP), who equally had no clue. The GP made an emergency referral at the Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) department of our local hospital. 

This was my first experience as an outpatient and not as a visitor. The ENT surgeon must have asked patients this set of questions many times before:

Surgeon: “How long have you had this lump for?”<br>
I: “No idea ……  I only inadvertently discovered it last week……”

“Any pain in the neck, throat, or headache?”<br>
“No, no pain at all.”

“How about swallowing, appetite and your weight? Any changes?”<br>
“Swallowing felt normal. Appetite is good, and my weight is stable.”

“I need to have a closer look at your throat. Have you had an endoscopy before?”<br>
“No, but there’s always the first time, right?”

The endoscopy only took a few minutes. Without having any scans, the surgeon gave a preliminary diagnosis of a rare tumour in the “parapharyngeal space”, and that the commonest treatment option is surgery. The immediate next step was to have an MRI scan to precisely locate the tumour, measure its size and have an idea of tumour type or the originating tissue.

<q>Sorry, what ‘space’ did you just say? I didn’t quite catch it.

The surgeon calmly repeated the anatomical term. I jotted it down for my homework that evening.

A cavity next to the pharynx? I’m a biologist but I’ve never heard of it!

Well, this is just the beginning of the many “unheard-ofs”. A lot more unknowns, uncertainties, unexpected experiences await!

<p class="cn">大年初一，星期六。凑巧周末過年，不用請假慶祝，真好。

<p class="cn">臨睡前如常用牙綫清潔牙縫、刷牙。那晚，我把嘴巴盡量張開，要看清楚最後面的智慧齒。皆因農曆年前去了一趟輕裝旅行，沒帶電動牙刷，雖然已盡量小心清潔四角的智慧齒，我還是不放心。

<p class="cn">「啊——」

<p class="cn">智慧齒沒異樣，總算護齒有功。

<p class="cn">且慢！爲什麽我的「吊鐘」**歪了，喉嚨左右不對稱？再仔細看看，左面智慧齒旁、口腔上蓋*與喉嚨相連之處隆起來了，並把本來位處正中的吊鐘往右邊推。

<p class="cn">我第一個反應是用手指按按隆起的它。結實的，不移位，卻不痛。如果痛，也可能有個簡單解釋，說是與智慧齒附近牙肉有關的發炎。然而，若是發炎就早該覺得不適，甚至寢食難安，哪可去旅行風流快活、大嚼團年飯？

<p class="cn">那究竟是什麽呢？大家都在猜。牙科其難雜症？囊腫水瘤？誰都不敢提「癌」，聞癌色變嘛。

<p class="cn">別猜了，也別拖延，盡早求醫。相熟的中醫學貫中西，說未遇過這樣的病例，中醫幫不上忙，着我快快去找西醫。家庭醫生也說病狀甚不尋常，馬上轉介我看區内綜合醫院的耳鼻喉專科急診。

<p class="cn">在此之前，我去醫院只有探病，從未看病。耳鼻喉外科醫生問症駕輕就熟：

<p class="cn">醫生：「這隆起的東西長了多久？」
<p class="cn">我:「不曉得……我是上星期無意中發現的……」

<p class="cn">「有沒有頭痛、頸痛、喉嚨痛？」
<p class="cn">「通通沒有。」

<p class="cn">「吞嚥呢？最近胃口和體重有沒有突變？」
<p class="cn">「吞嚥時不覺有阻礙物，胃口良好，體重穩定。」

<p class="cn">醫生說要用内窺鏡仔細檢查我咽喉附近。

<p class="cn">「以前接受過内窺鏡檢查沒？」
<p class="cn">「沒試過，但凡事總有第一次！」

<p class="cn">檢查不費時。不用掃描、造影，醫生就說頗肯定在 “parapharyngeal space” 内有一腫瘤，治療方法是動手術。下一步是做磁力共振造影去確認腫瘤起源組織、位置、大小、種類等。

<q class="cn">「不好意思，你剛才說什麽 “space” （空間、空隙）？」

<p class="cn">醫生不徐不疾，再說一遍。我略寫筆記，準備回家做功課。

<p class="cn">Pharynx （咽）旁邊原來有這樣一個空隙？唸生物科這麽多年，爲何我從未聽過？

<p class="cn">這只是開端。未知、未聽過、未見過、未見識過的、未體驗過的，陸續有來！

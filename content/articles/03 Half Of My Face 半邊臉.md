The two-week wait wasn’t that agonising. It really wasn’t.

Back then, for the vast majority of people in the UK, COVID-19 was still a foreign problem. Life just went on as usual. I went into the office everyday, led an independent life, had a healthy complexion, and was full of energy. I felt fit enough to travel to business meetings and found great pleasure in my hobbies. I even enjoyed a dinner and movie night out with a friend less than 24 hours before my fateful hospital appointment.

Was I not worried at all?

Well, the tumour’s mild symptoms didn’t interfere much with daily life. The tumour didn’t proclaim its existence every moment through pain or itch, so sometimes it’s really out of my mind. Having a busy schedule means having less headroom for unhelpful thoughts.

Or perhaps I was reassured by the statistics that most cases of this tumour were benign, so I didn’t have to worry about tumour stage, grading, metastasis or relapse-free survival? Another consolation was that the parapharyngeal space looked pretty cramped in the anatomical diagrams, so the tumour couldn’t be very big? Roughly the size of a table-tennis or golf ball? Would key-hole surgery suffice?

The hospital is close to my office. To make it to the 3:45pm appointment, I just finished the day earlier than usual and covered the outstanding hours with previously banked overtime. 

There were all sorts of people in the packed ENT outpatients waiting room. Middle-aged men attending postoperative follow-up, school-age children fitted with hearing aids, and healthy-looking people, like me. The department was busy with every clinic running behind schedule. That’s fine, time passed quite quickly when one could continue working on the phone. Finally my name was called after an hour’s wait.

The nurse who escorted me said with a chuckle, “you’re special, you know, two consultants wanted to take your case!”

Ha, what an “honour”! So who took me under his/her wings in the end? The consultant who carried out my initial examination?

No. I was greeted by an older, more experienced consultant. A warm and softly spoken gentleman, I reckoned he’s about 10 years younger than my parents. We exchanged pleasantries and introduced ourselves in turns. I told him how I was trained in genetics, have some understanding about tumours, and was a newbie hospital patient. He said he’s old-school and prefers looking after a patient throughout the whole journey, from presenting the diagnosis and treatment options, carrying out the operation, to monitoring the recovery. I didn’t think much of his remark at the time, but finally realised what he really meant a few months later.

“How old are you? 31?”<br>
“Haha, I wish!”

Doctor, you’re so kind! Those were the relatively care-free good old days. I pointed at my personal details on his computer screen, which showed my date of birth and age.<br>
“Oh yes! Well, it doesn’t matter, you’re still young.”

Before we got too comfortable with the small talks, it’s time for serious business.

“So, the MRI scans confirm the presence of a tumour in the parapharyngeal space.”

Yes, yes, that I already knew……

Next, he opened an MRI image file. Alas, you didn’t need to be an expert to tell that the image didn’t look good at all.

I finally saw it. It’s huge!

I kept my composure, “oh dear! It’s much larger than I expected!” While absorbing the shock, I did the typical 21st century thing — snapping photos of the images with my phone.

“Yes, it’s roughly the size of an orange or a large peach. Exact measurements? Let’s see ……”

>6.4 cm across. Half of my face measures 7cm, so&nbsp;the tumour was pretty much as wide as my&nbsp;left&nbsp;face

How long did it take for a runaway cell to grow into this mass, and with how much nutrients for sustenance? Well, who knows? Budding tumours of this type are often in stealth mode, making them super hard to detect, let alone to track over time. Regular dental check-ups with X-ray examinations wouldn’t help either as soft tissues are “transparent” to X-rays. 

Knowing that I’m teetotal and never smoked, the consultant said, “this is not a lifestyle tumour. It’s nothing to do with your habits or diet, so you couldn’t have done anything to prevent it. The good news is, though, it does appear to be a sheathed, membrane-bound benign tumour.”

Still, I wondered how come the tumour couldn’t be observed or felt from the outside, given its size?

“Ah, that’s because the tumour is boxed up by three sets of bones: the base of your skull, the mandible, and the spine.”

Is surgery the only treatment option?

“Yes, the tumour is too big to be left to its own devices. It’s squashing all the surrounding soft tissues and with time, there is always a risk it could turn malignant. We’ll fastrack the operation. It should happen in a few weeks’ time.”

“As for the operation itself, we have Plan A and Plan B.  Plan A is simpler and more preferable, with an incision that begins at the ear lobe, down the side of the neck, parallel to the jawline, towards the Adam’s apple area. If unfortunately we realise there isn’t enough room for manoeuvre, or there are complications with the tumour, then Plan B will be needed, which is an extension of Plan A, bringing the incision from the Adam’s apple area vertically upwards across the chin. You can either consent to transitioning from Plan A to B prior to the operation, or we can stitch up the incision after Plan A, wake you up, and discuss with you whether to proceed with Plan B.”

I responded with a wry smile, “well, if surgery is the only option and Plan A doesn’t work, I don’t really have much choice but to proceed with Plan B, right? What’s the point of waking me up and then reopening the wound again? Of course it makes sense to do it in one go.”

He continued, “the main risk of this operation is accidental damage to major cranial nerves which control all sorts of key bodily functions, such as digestion, speech, swallowing and taste. But we’ll try our best to avoid such complications. As for the scar, with Plan A, it’ll be similar to what happens after a facelift — very faint and well hidden in natural neck folds. There’s a good chance that we stick to Plan A anyway.”

We covered a lot of ground in 40 minutes. I had never had so much time to discuss something as thoroughly before with an *NHS doctor. At no point was I rushed, despite the clinic clearly running behind schedule. As we said goodbye, I wasn’t burdened with  unanswered questions; rather, it felt like the end of a lecture class on tumour surgery.

So…… table-tennis? Golf? No, it’s tennis!

Keyhole surgery? Forget about it. Free facelift, anyone?

Looks like I haven’t done my homework properly this time……

<p class="cn">等待的日子一點也不難捱。

<p class="cn">那時候，COVID-19 對英國普羅大衆來説是遙遠他鄉的問題，社會運作正常。我每天上班、照顧自己起居飲食，臉色紅潤，健步如飛，有魄力出差開會、有興致彈琴和試做新菜式。取磁力共振掃描報告前一晚還去跟朋友吃飯、聊個痛快、看電影。

<p class="cn">真的不擔心？

<p class="cn">腫瘤病癥輕微，確實不太干擾日常生活。不痛不癢，就不會分分秒秒提醒着，有時真的忘了它還在。生活充實，自然沒空胡思亂想。

<p class="cn">也可能是因爲文獻說腫瘤多數屬良性，不用擔心是早期還是末期、會否擴散、治癒後存活率高低。看過解剖學圖片，腫瘤所在的那空隙狹小得很，它應該不會太大吧？大概像個乒乓球、高爾夫球？或許微創手術就可把它取出？

<p class="cn">會診時間是下午三點四十五分。醫院離公司很近，早退幾小時，以平日的超時工作相抵。

<p class="cn">耳鼻喉科門診部坐滿了人，男女老幼。有手術後覆診的大叔，有戴着助聽器的小孩，也有很多貌似健康的常人，如我。門診繁忙，我等了差不多一小時才聽到護士喊我的名字。沒所謂，一邊等，一邊滑手機處理公事，時間過得快。

<p class="cn">護士邊走邊打趣說，「你真特別，有兩位顧問級醫生 （consultants）都想做你的主診呢！」

<p class="cn">我「受寵若驚」。花落誰家？是當日替我檢查的那位嗎？

<p class="cn">不是。是個資深的顧問級醫生，年紀比我父母小十歲左右，表情與語氣都和藹可親。初次見面不免來幾句客套話。我說我是唸遺傳學的，略懂腫瘤一二，但平生從無大病。他說他風格傳統，喜歡「一條龍」式照顧病人，由確診、手術到復康過程，一手包辦。這句話，當時我沒太放在心上，要幾個月後才聽懂。

<p class="cn">「你今年多大？三十一？」

<p class="cn">我也想啊，那是個少憂少慮的年代啊！醫生，你真懂得逗人開心。你跟前的電腦有我的個人資料，清楚列明出生日期和年齡啊！

<p class="cn">「啊，都一樣，你還年輕。」

<p class="cn">輕鬆開場白過後，馬上認真入正題。

<p class="cn">「磁力共振造影顯示 parapharyngeal space 裏確實有一腫瘤。」

<p class="cn">這個我早知道，不是新聞。話語剛落，醫生打開造影圖像檔案，按圖解説。

<p class="cn">是一幀連門外漢也一眼看出異樣的照片。

<p class="cn">終於見到它了。龐然的它！

<p class="cn">我有科學家的冷靜，但仍難掩驚訝：「嘩！怎麽這麽大！？我真想不到……」驚訝之餘，一個廿一世紀的病人會做什麽？當然是掏出手機拍下影像！

<p class="cn">「是的，大小與一個柳橙或水蜜桃相約。讓我量一量它有多寬……」

>6.4 厘米。我半邊臉才濶 7 厘米。就是說，腫瘤幾乎跟我左臉一樣濶。

<p class="cn">要多少年月、汲取了多少養分才由一個細胞滋長到這麽大？天曉得！腫瘤初期極難偵測，更遑論定時追蹤。就算定期去牙科保健檢查照 X 光也看不見，因爲有別於骨頭，軟組織是「透明」的。

<p class="cn">醫生知我不煙不酒，安慰說：「這類腫瘤與飲食習慣、不良嗜好無關，避無可避。看來它被膜包住，應該屬良性。」

<p class="cn">這麽大的腫瘤，爲什麽在體外完全看不見、摸不到？

<p class="cn">「那是因爲它剛好被三塊骨頭擋住：頭骨底部、顎骨和脊骨。」

<p class="cn">一定要施手術嗎？

<p class="cn">「要，因爲它已經這麽大，壓住四周的組織、器官。再者，若留在體内，怕有機會變惡性，所以我們會盡快排期，大概幾星期左右吧。」

<p class="cn">「這種手術，我們有兩手準備，首選 Plan A 與副選 Plan B。Plan A 是由耳垂開始，沿頸側，與顎綫平行，朝喉結方向開刀。如果打開後發現不夠空位取出腫瘤，或情況比預期複雜，那就要行 Plan B，從喉結往上開刀到唇下，復原會慢得多。手術前，你可以授權我們按實況應變，直接由 Plan A 延續到 Plan B；亦可以要求我們先把 Plan A 傷口縫合，待麻醉藥力過後問你的意願，再決定是否繼續 Plan B。」

<p class="cn">我苦笑道：「醫生，這也算是『選擇』麽？若真的要行 Plan B，那當然一氣呵成啦，難道無事生事，多捱幾刀，自討苦吃？」

<p class="cn">醫生續說：「手術的最大風險是傷及頸部幾條主要腦神經綫，它們控制消化、説話、味覺、吞嚥等等。不過請放心，我們會盡量小心。至於疤痕，你的情況應該無須執行 Plan B。 Plan A 帶來的疤痕很淡、很隱蔽，就像做拉面皮除皺整容手術一樣，尤其是頸側的，康復後，看上去跟天然頸紋無異。」

<p class="cn">四十分鐘的會診，醫生由始至終耐心解説、聆聽，沒有因爲其他病人久候而催促我。在此之前，我未試過與 NHS^ 的醫生如此仔細討論病情。踏出診症室那刻，不是滿肚子疑問，而像是上了一節腫瘤外科課。

<p class="cn">乒乓球？高爾夫球？不！是網球！

<p class="cn">微創手術？南柯一夢矣！免費「整容」才是！

<p class="cn">看來，這份功課我做得太馬虎了。

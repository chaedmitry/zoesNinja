It was a chilly evening as I left the outpatients department.

Perplexed? No, the treatment plan, risks, pros and cons were all clear.

“So the operation will be at the end of March or early April”, I reckoned. That’s pretty soon. On my way back to the office, I shared the latest news and the shocking MRI image with my family, close friends and my boss. Gotta start planning and get into position, folks.

Scared? Of course.

I’m the timid kind that wouldn’t consider piercing my ears just for earrings. In the kitchen, I rarely hurt myself with cuts or burns. I’m also almost immune to sports injuries. But now a major operation awaits! You know the kind of movie scene where a baddie holds a knife against a hostage’s neck? That’s roughly where the knife would be on my neck!

I dreaded the pain. The scar (will I have to wear my hair long again?) Damage to major nerves. But what could I do? There’s no running away from the operation. But I didn’t and don’t fear death. This is not a terminal illness, the chance of it killing me is very low. I wasn’t going to get wound up by this.

Whenever I am served bad news, my rational brain automatically takes charge. Its motto is like the public message from the British government before WWII: “Keep calm and carry on”. That’s exactly what I did and looked —  at the outpatients clinic, on the street, on the bus, or when messaging people about the diagnosis. My teacher once said that I rarely get emotional trauma whatever life throws at me and remain as cool as a cucumber. Others, especially those who work with me, had the impression of me being an armoured warrior queen on horseback who “fights” each “battle” stoically, with rigour.

Still, there are limits for my rationality. I’m not a robot. I wasn’t returning to my office desk straightaway to answer emails and calls, as if nothing had happened.

I needed some quiet, private place to digest what I had taken in and organise my thoughts. My car was parked at a quieter corner of the company carpark, that’s where I needed to be.

In the driving seat. I sat upright, but my heart slumped. What came to my mind? The unforgettable MRI image? Plan A vs Plan B? No. I saw a huge wave. A tsunami.

I’m not a novice in surfing waves in life. Whatever cards life dealt me, I accepted. The past decade had been an intense training period, with wave after wave which kept growing in height. I never shied away from them, and thankfully didn’t drown either. It made me quite a skilled surfer. 

Enough training for now? I was a bit worn out. “Can I take a break, please?” No. The next wave was ascending and approaching fast! 

Oh, great ……

“Whatever doesn’t kill you make you stronger”? “Suffering makes you a better person”? “Every cloud has a silver lining”?

I needed to speak to someone. A very good friend swiftly turned up. The warrior queen’s armour was shed. It wasn’t long before I bursted into tears and cried my eyes out. They weren’t tears of fear, not “why me?” but “why now!?”

It was a long chat. The car was really cold, of course it was. Neither of us had thought of turning the heating on……

So, my emotional brain had finally spoken; it was now at peace. The ball was passed back to my rational self to figure out how best to surf this tsunami.

The only other time that I shedded a tear in this journey was many months later, when the pain from the numerous oral ulcers was so intense —  a nasty side effect of radiotherapy. (Yes, I do dread physical pain…...)

<hr>

<p class="cn">離開門診的那個黃昏特別冷。

<p class="cn">前路茫茫？不，治療方案、風險、利弊都清晰得很。

<p class="cn">三月底、四月初就要動手術了吧？回公司的路上，我跟家人、幾位摯友和老闆報平安，並分享面診的要點和那嚇人的磁力共振影像。時間不多，大家都要各就各位了。

<p class="cn">怕不怕？怕。

<p class="cn">我平日是個連穿個洞戴耳環也不肯的人，下廚多年甚少刀傷、燙傷，亦甚少因運動而受傷，如今竟然要做大手術！開刀的位置就像電視劇中歹徒勒頸持刀挾持人質的姿勢一樣，名副其實刀架頸上！

<p class="cn">怕痛。怕留痕。（要不要時光倒流留長髮，做遮掩？）怕傷及主要神經。但是怕又如何？手術還是要做的。就是不怕死，因爲這不是絕症、末期癌症，嘿，別自己嚇自己。

<p class="cn">面對突如其來的壞消息，我的理性面會自動站出來「主持大局」。不論是在會診室、街上、巴士、還是發佈病訊，大家見我氣定神閑。有老師曾說我「百毒不侵」，泰山崩於前而色不變似的。亦有人說我像個策馬披甲上陣的女皇，遇敵殺敵。是的，那是大部分人看到的一面，尤其是職場上公事的。

<p class="cn">不過，理性面再強，我也未至於傻得急不及待返囘辦公室，若無其事繼續處理公務。

<p class="cn">我需要躲在一個私人空間好好消化消息、整理想法。我的車剛好在公司停車場不太當眼處，是獨處的好地方。

<p class="cn">在駕駛座。姿勢是筆挺的，卻覺得自己在癱坐着。眼前浮現的不是那一見難忘的磁力共振影像，也不是 Plan A、B，是巨浪。是海嘯。

<p class="cn">說「衝浪」也好，「滑浪」也好，我也算駕輕就熟了。過往十年，在公在私，挑戰、苦難、找上門的麻煩不絕，一次比一次風高浪急，屢次迎難而上，幸未被淹沒，練出一副好身手，但我有點累了。我想，也磨練夠了吧？

<p class="cn">正當我以爲有個踹息空檔，啊，下一個浪又來了，而且要比之前的更高！難道如孟子所言：「天將降大任於斯人也， 必先苦其心志， 勞其筋骨， 餓其體膚， 空乏其身」？老天爺啊，我不求辦什麽大事啊！你可以選我，我不迴避，但可否等等？爲何偏偏挑這個時候？

<p class="cn">百感交集。

<p class="cn">急召好友來停車場。女皇的盔甲早卸下來了。才説不到幾句，我就大哭一場，把對老天爺的控訴一次過發洩出來。

<p class="cn">我們在冰冷的車廂聊了好久。原來我沒留意要開暖氣……

<p class="cn">感性面釋放了、安頓了，理性面可以繼續部署這個「海嘯」該怎樣衝。

<p class="cn">那天過後，除了放療期間一次因口腔潰瘍劇痛（我怕痛嘛），我就沒再為此病流過一滴淚。

In terms of incidence, comparing to tumours of the lung, colon, breast and prostate, those in the head and neck (H&N) region are rather uncommon. If you ask me to name some H&N cancers, I would think of those of the nasopharynx, thyroid, oesophagus and tongue. According to some statistics presented by the charity Cancer Research UK, in a given year, of all new cancer diagnoses in the UK, about 3% are in the H&N (12238 cases recorded between 2015 and 2017). Among all H&C cancer sufferers, most are over 50 years old, and 70% are male.

Tumours hiding in the parapharyngeal space are even rarer. Some literature suggested only 1% of H&N tumours (benign and malignant combined) are found in that inverted pyramid-shaped cavity. 

>It dawned on me that I’ve won the genetic lottery “jackpot”! Oh wow!

Or for some people, this experience may remind them of another “jack” —— Jack-in-the-box. Surprise!

What is the chance of this random genetic mutation happening in the parapharyngeal space of a forty-something-year-old female to drive the growth of a very rare kind of tumour?

Infinitesimal! But yes, very rare events can and do happen.

There’s some good news though —— around 80% of tumours in the parapharyngeal space were benign, so there’s a good chance that mine also was! “Lightning doesn't strike the same place twice”, right? (OK, scientifically this actually is not true, but let’s not get into that here, ha!) Other people got cancers, I only had a tumour, it’s not that bad, “relax”, I told myself.

Since my condition is so rare, most ENT specialists would only see a handful of cases in their entire professional career. Which makes me wonder, during my emergency referral, how the consultant surgeon managed to give me the preliminary diagnosis at the spot so effortlessly, with such confidence and authority, without having to consult any medical literature? Amazing!

Winning the “jackpot” was unexpected, just as I wouldn’t expect to get the top prize straightaway in the upcoming draw if I purchase a lottery ticket today.

Were there really not the faintest hint beforehand, friends and family asked?

Well, yes, there were hints. However, the symptoms were mild and intermittent, with plausible explanations for them all, so I didn’t think much of them and certainly didn’t attribute them to the presence of a tumour.

Around two months prior to spotting the tumour, as I woke up every morning, I started noticing a dry mouth, especially the tongue. It was late autumn, so I blamed that on the central heating being too strong and the humidity too low. Then there were a few episodes of nerve pain in my left ear, each lasting a second or two. My hearing seemed fine afterwards, so I just left it as that. I also had problems with a slightly blocked nose on the left side, as well as an “aeroplane ear” on my left that took ages to subside after each flight. Since I had had a rather bad cold that autumn, I put those down to a lingering cold that I hadn’t yet shaken off.

Hindsight is a wonderful thing. By now of course I know the oral dryness was the result of my tongue’s surface fitting too nicely to the bulging soft palate, blocking the flow of saliva. As for the pain and feelings of obstruction, they were the result of the tumour pushing onto soft tissues around it. The only structures which withstood the pressure from the tumour were the hard bones.

I had the MRI scan on Valentine’s Day. So I, the biologist, spent the day with the tumour, thinking about how it all started, how it quietly took on a life of its own while I whizzed through my hectic days, and lamented how come we hadn’t met sooner. How “romantic”!

The imaging technicians were all softly spoken and kind. Professional rules prohibit them from discussing or sharing the images with patients, just in case some patients take the information the wrong way, either be happy too soon or worried about something that turned out to be a false alarm. The responsibility of analysing the scan images, considering all evidence and coming up with a diagnosis lies with the consultant surgeon that I would be assigned to.

Having said that, with all the scans carried out every day, technicians must from time to time encounter some images which even to the layman eye look pretty worrisome? One can’t really “unsee” them, can you? I guess it's difficult not to have one's heartstrings tugged by some tragic cases.

What did my scans show? It was a two-week wait before I got to meet the consultant responsible for my case.

<p class="cn">相對於長在肺、結腸、乳房、前列腺等器官的腫瘤，長在頭、頸的其實不多。若要我舉出頭頸癌的例子，我會想到鼻咽癌、甲狀腺癌、食道癌和舌癌。根據研究癌症的慈善機構 CRUK 的統計數據，英國每年確診的新癌症病例中，頭頸癌佔 3%（2015 至 2017 年間錄得 12238 宗），患者多數五十歲或以上，約 70% 為男士。

<p class="cn">躲在 parapharyngeal space 的腫瘤就更罕見。有文獻說，爲數不多的頭頸腫瘤中，良性與惡性的都算在内，只 1% 長在那倒轉金字塔形的空隙内。

<blockquote class="cn">原來我中了「頭獎」！</blockquote>

<p class="cn">不知是幾百萬、還是千萬分之幾的機會，這發生在 parapharyngeal space 、讓腫瘤發跡的隨機基因特變，竟然「選」中我這個才四十出頭的女生！

<p class="cn">啊，不，應該說是「頭」獎？哈！

<p class="cn">還好，近 80% 長在 parapharyngeal space 的腫瘤是良性，就是說我的也很可能是！得此腫瘤已是千載難逢，總不會連中兩元，來個惡性的吧？人家患癌，而我只是區區有個腫瘤而已，無需恐慌。

<p class="cn">如此罕見的腫瘤，許多耳鼻喉專科醫生畢生可能只遇上寥寥幾個病例。替我檢查的醫生竟然不用翻查醫書，仿佛不假思索就可斷症，佩服，佩服！

<p class="cn">「中獎」的確是意料之外，猶如買抽獎彩票一擊即中巨額頭獎一樣。

<p class="cn">然而，親友不禁疑惑，真的毫無丁點先兆？

<p class="cn">的確是有蛛絲馬跡。只是病癥輕微、間歇性，有合理解釋，就不會杞人憂天聯想到有腫瘤。

<p class="cn">發現腫瘤前兩個月左右，每天早上起來時我特別口乾，尤其是舌頭。那時正值深秋，我以爲是暖氣太強，室内空氣太乾燥。左耳曾有幾次維持一、兩秒的神經痛，但我聽覺無異樣，也就作罷。左邊有輕微鼻塞，下飛機後左耳的氣壓總是久久不能回復正常，我歸咎於感冒未清。

<p class="cn">事後孔明。其實家裏暖氣强弱，多年來沒大變化，口乾是因爲睡覺時舌頭表面緊貼着隆起的軟顎，沾不到口水。其他左耳、左鼻的病癥就是因爲腫瘤往四方八面伸展，只要不是硬骨頭，任何軟組織都被它擠壓。

<p class="cn">磁力共振造影安排在情人節那天。一個唸生物學的人與蟄伏自己體内的腫瘤朝夕共處，想象它的起源，我有我的日理萬機，它有它自顧自悄悄的繁衍，相逢恨晚…… 真「浪漫」！

<p class="cn">負責造影的技術員都很客氣。守則規定他們只能管掃描的事，禁止與病人談論掃描時看見什麽，更遑論即時與病人分享影像，以防他們無意中誤導病人，令他們空歡喜或虛驚一場。分析影像、歸納所有資料得出診斷結果，那是顧問級主診醫生的職責。
話雖如此，技術員每天照顧那麽多病人，定會偶爾遇到難忘的掃描，也就是連普通人也能一眼看得出不妙那種？總不能視若無睹？心有戚戚然，也是人之常情吧？

<p class="cn">我的掃描結果究竟如何？兩星期後主診醫生揭盅。

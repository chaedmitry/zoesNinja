COVID-19 cases in the UK started to surge in mid-March. Day after day hospitals admitted more patients with severe COVID symptoms and were reaching full capacity. To prevent the whole system from collapsing, the NHS announced on 17 March that from 15 April onwards, all “non urgent” operations would be postponed by three months.
 
How should I read into this? The postponement would take effect from mid-April, but my operation had no confirmed date yet; would the rule apply to me? And what was the definition of “non urgent”? My condition was clearly not life-threatening, but was it “non urgent”? Didn’t my surgeon say my operation was fast tracked? 
 
If my operation would be delayed, should I wait, or should I seek alternatives to remove the ninja as soon as possible? There was so much to ponder on:
 
- Would the ninja grow significantly in the next few months, tipping the operation from Plan A to Plan B?
- While waiting, would the ninja turn malignant or metastasise? Did the CT scan uncover new problems?
- My symptoms were still very mild. Perhaps it wasn’t a big deal to wait a bit?
- Should I go private? NHS and private hospitals in the UK are served by more or less the same doctors, the only difference is medical cost — we’re talking about tens of thousands of pounds……

That evening when the NHS decision was announced, I remember I was going to make my favourite Georgian dumpling (called khinkali), but the new uncertainty almost derailed my cooking project. But then I knew simply by worrying to death I wouldn’t be able to change the course of events, life had to go on anyway, so I rolled up my sleeves and pressed on with the dumplings. Getting busy in the kitchen was a healthy distraction anyway, both emotionally and physically. For the latter, ever since my initial diagnosis, I have strived to eat healthily. A silly thought popped up one day, “Umm… with all the nutrients, am I encouraging the ninja to grow? If I downsize, would the ninja too?” What a Medieval approach to starving a tumour, ha! If that works, who needs surgery?
 
I tossed and turned in bed that night. Knowing the hospital would be overwhelmed by phone calls from anxious patients the next day, I didn’t want to squeeze into the enquiry queue. Yet, in the end I still had to call the ENT outpatients department, not only for my own sake but also my colleagues, for they also needed to get prepared for the day when I would sign off work for them to take over. The ENT receptionist was friendly and to-the-point. She knew I should speak to the ENT admissions coordinator, and quickly shared with me the direct line’s number.
 
The coordinator holds information on the booked-in dates of operations, which patient comes first, and who the patients’ surgeons are. I finally managed to reach her after multiple tries. She must have been running around all day to fit patients into the revised schedule, answering numerous calls with the same question, “is my operation cancelled or postponed?” I was prepared to cut the long story short. To my surprise, the coordinator spoke warmly right from the start. She said I shouldn’t feel bad about calling because operations make some patients anxious in the first place and any postponement, even if hypothetical, makes it even harder to bear. She brought up my details on her screen, “ah, the doctor has just added you to the waiting list today. Most operations on the waiting list are not for postponement. However, none of the operations on the list has been booked in yet due to COVID-19.”
 
That was partly reassuring, but without a booked-in date, it’s far from clear whether I could/should delay the operation. The coordinator then suggested, “shall I arrange a phone call from the doctor so you can discuss in detail?” “Yes, please!” That’s brilliant, indeed. I had always wanted to hear about the CT scan results from my surgeon, but didn’t manage to reach him via his secretary, who was probably snowed under by patients’ enquiries too, or in the worst case, my surgeon had caught COVID-19 and couldn’t take calls……
 
My surgeon’s call was scheduled in a few days’ time. While waiting, I had a weird dream one night! The dream began with me seeing lots of people bustling around fairly haphazardly in the operating theatre. The next scene quickly switched to me waking up from the operation. In the dream, I felt no pain but some stiffness on my left jaw and neck. Next, I asked the surgeon which plan he had gone for, he said “B”! But this is clearly illogical, like most dreams are; if it had been Plan B, there would be a long vertical wound down my chin, how could I have spoken with such ease? 

It’s obvious why I constructed such a dream. It was easy to fend off scary thoughts during the day when I was occupied by work and hobbies, but the subconscious fear of the operation and pain took over in my sleep. 

Guess what, the scenes from the weird dream turned out to be not so unreal after all! Some were strikingly similar to what happened before and after my operation. How cool would it be if I could foresee the future for other matters too?

Fast tracked or postponed? To wait or not to wait? Those were the questions which I fortunately had answers for, supplemented by analyses, from my lovely surgeon first-hand. I wondered whether other patients with less “old-fashioned” surgeons only found out via the standard formal letters from the hospital?

<p class="cn">三月中，英國 COVID-19 疫情開始緊張。全國醫院住滿染疫的人，紛紛告急。 NHS 醫療系統超負荷，遂於三月十七日宣佈，由四月十五日起，所有非緊急（“non urgent”）手術延期三個月。
 
<p class="cn">那可圈可點啊！從四月中起 —  我那還未有確定日期的手術算不算在内呢？「非緊急」的定義又是什麽呢？主診醫生不是說「盡快排期」的嗎？我當然不是性命垂危，不能說手術刻不容緩，但無論自己多不願刀架頸上也不宜耽擱。
 
<p class="cn">假若延期，我該等，還是另想辦法除之而後快？要考慮的可多了：

<ul> 
    <li class="cn">隱者會不會在未來幾個月越長越大，手術由 Plan A 變 Plan B？
    <li class="cn">等得太久，隱者會否變成惡性，甚至開始擴散？CT 掃描有沒有找到新問題？
    <li class="cn">我的病癥還是輕微的，多等一會兒不算辛苦吧？
    <li class="cn">要不要自掏腰包去私家醫院做手術？其實在英國私立、公立醫院服務的都是同一羣醫生，只是私家醫療費要動輒幾萬鎊，傾家蕩產……
</ul>

<p class="cn">那晚我本來滿心歡喜，準備好材料要弄我愛吃的格魯吉亞包點（khinkali）。手術忽然前途未卜，心情很不爽，我幾乎動也不想動。然而，既然擔心也改變不了現狀，生活還是要繼續，那就別浪費材料，khinkali 我還是要吃的！在廚房忙着也好，轉移視綫，別老是向壞的一邊想。
 
<p class="cn">其實，説來，從確診腫瘤開始，我都盡量保持健康飲食。有一次我忽發奇想：「營養那麽豐富，豈非在滋養着隱者？如果我瘦了，他會不會一樣縮小？」我笑自己病傻了，竟然會想到如此原始、不文明的「苦肉計」！
 
<p class="cn">那天晚上還是睡不好。想到不少與我一樣憂心的病人會打電話到醫院查詢，我本來不想麻煩耳鼻喉科的，但電話我最後還是打了。也不只是為我自己，因爲我的同事也要知道大約何時開始接手我的工作，大家好有個準備。耳鼻喉科接待處的職員很客氣，知道我的來意，沒有耍官腔，就給我一個直綫電話號碼去找負責安排病人入院做手術的那位。該負責人有病人做手術的日期、先後次序、操刀的外科醫生等資料。
 
<p class="cn">好不容易才跟這位負責人聯絡上。她那天定是忙得團團轉，「我的手術是否延期？」這問題肯定答了無數次，我打算長話短説。沒想到傳來的是一把溫暖、安撫人心的聲音，完全聼不出一絲不耐煩。她很體諒病人的心情，因爲動手術本身對一些病人來説已夠憂慮了，再加上手術可能延期，病人就更擔心，所以她着我無須覺得不要意思。她邊查看我的資料，邊說：「啊，你的主診醫生剛把你的手術放在候補名單上。候補的手術就是已經開始排隊，通常不會延期。不過，由於疫情越來越緊，全部在名單上的手術都未有確定日期。」
 
<p class="cn">話雖如此，該等、不該等的問題其實還未解決。「啊，不如我叫主診醫生打電話給你好好的談談？」這太好了，我一直想問醫生 CT 掃描結果如何，但聯絡不上，還擔心他會否不幸染疫……醫生的秘書看來也挺忙，聯絡了好幾次也沒回音。這樣一來就一石二鳥。
 
<p class="cn">等待醫生來電的幾天，有一晚我做了一個怪夢！夢一開始，我看見手術室裏面的人都很忙亂。下一個場景就是我手術完畢、剛醒過來的時候，我完全不覺得痛，只是覺得左邊臉、頸有點綳緊。夢中的我問主診醫生是 Plan A 還是 Plan B，他說 B！那夢境當然是不合邏輯的。假若是 Plan B，我下頷剛開刀，又怎能隨意開口説話呢？

<p class="cn">做怪夢的原因顯而易見。不管平日工作再忙，日子過得再充實，白天沒空胡思亂想，睡着了，潛意識還是怕動手術，怕痛。

<p class="cn">意想不到的是，現實中動手術那天的經歷竟然跟怪夢相似！如果人生中其他事情也可以這樣預知未來，那有多棒！

<p class="cn">延期不延期？等不等？我很幸運，是主診醫生親自告知、分析、解釋。其他沒有遇上「一條龍」照顧的病人是不是接過醫院的正規公函才得知？
